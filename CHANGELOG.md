# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0-beta.3] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- Enhanced `image` tool to support optional immediate analysis of the captured screenshot by providing a `question` and `provider_config`.
  - If a `question` is given and no `path` is specified, the image is saved to a temporary location and deleted after analysis.
  - If a `question` is given, Base64 image data is not returned in the `content` array; the analysis result becomes the primary payload, alongside image metadata.

### Changed
- Migrated test runner from Jest to Vitest.
- Updated documentation (`README.md`, `docs/spec.md`) to reflect new `image` tool capabilities.

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - Previous Release Date

### Fixed
- (Summarize fixes from beta.2 if known, otherwise remove or mark as TBD)

### Added
- Initial E2E tests for CLI image capture.
